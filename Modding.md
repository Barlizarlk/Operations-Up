operation's up uses the MODS folder. by default there is nothing in it exept for modTemplate.ZIP and a text file. for making a mod. you will extract that zip file and rename it to whatever.

Characters: the Characters folder is where you put your custom characters. this system uses JSON files.

Custom events: This uses LUA for the code. and it uses TXT files to read the description

Custom notestypes: This uses LUA for the code

data: this is where you put your song's charts. this uses JSON files. make sure to include all difficulties to prevent possible issues. (Noob, Normal, Hard, Expert, Insane) difficulties use a prefix such as "Example-Hard" Charts that use the Normal difficulty does not use a prefix. so it would just be "Example"

Images: Self explanitory really.
